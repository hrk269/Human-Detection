# Converted 2D color images into the Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HoG) feature vector and implemented a Multi-Layer Perceptron in Python to detect humans in the input image
#	Trained a Multi-Layer Perceptron through back propagation with positive and negative training images 
#	Performed gradient operations and edge magnitude normalization on image to help create HoG vector
#	Quantized unsigned gradient angles into 9 histogram bins used to create HoG feature vector for testing
#	Fed HoG feature forward through Neural Network to output whether a human was detected
